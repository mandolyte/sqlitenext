# Sqlite3 with Next.js

I have moved some things around in order to have multiple 
experiments and examples in the same repo.

Each folder is described below.

## in-mem-main-thread

This shows an example of using an in-memory database. 
It runs on the main thread and might be used within hooks
as any such database connection might be.

There is a README with more details.

## worker

Now working. See README for details.
